Introduction
A Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) to 7-Segment Display Converter is a digital circuit that converts a 4-bit BCD input into the corresponding 7-segment display representation. This allows for the display of decimal digits on a 7-segment display, which is commonly used in digital clocks, calculators, and other electronic devices. In this example, we will use Verilog to implement a circuit that takes a 4-bit input, checks if it is greater than 9, adjusts the value if necessary, and drives two 7-segment displays.


---------------------------------------------Code Explanation--------------------------------------------------------

1)Module Definition and Inputs/Outputs:
The top_module is defined with a 4-bit input (SW) and outputs for two 7-segment displays (HEX1 and HEX0).

2)Internal Wires and Variables:

V: Holds the 4-bit input.
z: Indicates if the input is greater than 9.
A: Holds the adjusted value of V if it is greater than 9.
d0: The value to be displayed on the lower 7-segment display.
d1: The value to be displayed on the upper 7-segment display (0 or 1).

3)Comparator:
The comparator checks if the 4-bit input (V) is greater than 9 by evaluating the most significant bits.

4)Circuit A:
If the input is greater than 9, 10 is subtracted from the input to adjust it to a valid BCD range.

5)Multiplexer:
The multiplexer selects the adjusted value (A) if the input is greater than 9, otherwise it selects the original input (V).

6)d1 Assignment:
The value for d1 is set to 1 if the input is greater than 9, otherwise it is set to 0.

7)7-Segment Display Decoding:
The seg7_decoder module converts each 4-bit value into the corresponding 7-segment display pattern. The decoded outputs are used to drive the 7-segment displays.
