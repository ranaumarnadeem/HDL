This folder includes implementations of four types of multipliers. The Array Multiplier uses a straightforward approach with a grid of AND gates and adders to generate and sum partial products. The Carry-Save Multiplier builds on this by using carry-save adders to handle intermediate sums more efficiently, reducing delay. The Booth Multiplier employs Booth's algorithm to minimize the number of partial products and operations, making multiplication more efficient, especially for signed numbers. Lastly, the Wallace Tree Multiplier utilizes a parallel structure to accelerate the multiplication process by iteratively reducing the number of partial products through a three-step process.

To use these implementations, clone this repository and integrate the Verilog code into your digital design projects. For more detailed explanations and insights into these binary multipliers, you can refer to my Medium and Substack posts. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or GitHub for any questions or suggestions.
