We first define the inputs a and b as 4-bit binary numbers and the output product as an 8-bit binary number to accommodate the maximum possible result of multiplying two 4-bit numbers.

The partial products p0, p1, p2, and p3 are generated by performing bitwise AND operations between each bit of b and the entire a. This results in four partial products where each is a 4-bit value.

Next, we proceed with three stages of addition. The first stage adds p0 and the left-shifted p1. Since p1 represents the product of a and the second bit of b, it is shifted left by one bit. The sum of these two values (sum1) and the carry bits (carry1) are calculated separately. The carry bits represent positions where both input bits are 1, indicating that there is a need for a carry in the next higher bit position.

In the second stage, sum1 is added to the left-shifted p2 (shifted left by two bits). This addition also produces a sum (sum2) and carry bits (carry2).

The third stage adds sum2 to the left-shifted p3 (shifted left by three bits), resulting in sum3 and carry bits (carry3).

Finally, in the last step combines the final sums and carry bits to produce the final product. The carry bits from each stage are appropriately shifted to their respective positions before adding them to the final sum.
