Introduction
A Digital Clock is a common application of digital circuits, displaying time using a combination of counters and display decoders. In this example, we will use Verilog to implement a digital clock that counts seconds using BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) counters and displays the count on 7-segment displays.

The provided code consists of multiple modules: 
-a clock divider to generate a one-second pulse
-a BCD counter to count the seconds
-a BCD to 7-segment decoder to display the count.

---------------------------------------------------------Code Explanation-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)Module Definition and Inputs/Outputs:
The top_module is defined with inputs for the clock and reset signal. Outputs include signals for the 7-segment displays to show the BCD count.

2)Clock Divider:
The clock_divider module takes the input clock signal and divides it to generate a one-second pulse. This pulse is used to increment the BCD counters.

3)BCD Counter:
The bcd_counter module consists of three mod10_counter instances to count the BCD digits. Each counter rolls over after counting from 0 to 9 and triggers the next counter.

4)7-Segment Display Decoding:
The bcd_to_7segment module converts each 4-bit BCD digit into the corresponding 7-segment display pattern. The decoded outputs are used to drive the 7-segment displays.

5)Rollover Handling:
Each mod10_counter has a rollover output that triggers the next counter in the chain, ensuring proper counting across multiple digits.
