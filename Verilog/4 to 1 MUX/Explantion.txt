Introduction
A Multiplexer (MUX) is a digital circuit that selects one of several input signals and forwards the selected input to a single output line. It is a fundamental component in digital electronics used for routing data from multiple sources. In this example, we will use Verilog to implement a simple 2-to-1 multiplexer that selects between two 4-bit inputs based on a select signal.

The provided Verilog code demonstrates a 2-to-1 multiplexer that takes two 4-bit inputs (x and y) and a 1-bit select signal (s). The selected input is routed to the output (m), and the LEDs are set to zero.

1)Module Definition and Inputs/Outputs:
The Task2 module is defined with inputs for two 4-bit signals (x and y) and a 1-bit select signal (s). Outputs include a 4-bit signal (m) and a 4-bit LED output (LED).

2)Multiplexer Logic:
The multiplexer logic is implemented using a conditional (ternary) operator. If the select signal (s) is 1, the output (m) is assigned the value of x. Otherwise, the output (m) is assigned the value of y.

3)LED Control:
The LED output (LED) is set to zero, meaning all LEDs are turned off.
