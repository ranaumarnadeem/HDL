A ring counter is a type of sequential logic circuit and a specific form of a shift register, where the output of the last flip-flop is fed back to the input of the first flip-flop, creating a "ring." In its simplest form, a ring counter consists of a series of flip-flops connected in a closed loop, where only one flip-flop is set to '1' at any given time, with all others set to '0'. This '1' bit is circulated around the ring on each clock pulse.

In the operation of a 4-bit ring counter, the output starts with a single high bit (e.g., `0001`). On each clock cycle, this bit shifts one position to the left, moving through the sequence `0010`, `0100`, `1000`, and then wrapping around back to `0001`. This process continues as long as the circuit is enabled, effectively cycling through the states in a predictable manner.

The key advantage of a ring counter is its simplicity and the ease with which it can generate a sequence of outputs that can be directly used for timing or control purposes. The reset signal (`rst_n`), which is active low in this design, is used to initialize the counter to its starting state. When the reset signal is asserted (i.e., set to low), the counter resets to the initial state with a single '1' bit and all other bits as '0'. When the reset is deasserted (set to high), the counter begins its operation, shifting the '1' bit around the ring with each clock pulse.

The synchronous nature of the ring counter ensures that all flip-flops update their states simultaneously on each clock edge, making it a reliable and predictable component in digital systems where precise timing and sequencing are required. This makes ring counters particularly useful in applications such as divide-by-N counters, pattern generation, and state machines.
